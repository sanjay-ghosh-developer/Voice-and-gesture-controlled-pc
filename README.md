# Voice-and-gesture-controlled-pc
The purpose of gesture and voice recognition in Computers has always been the minimization of the distance between the physical world and the digital world. The way humans interact among themselves could be implemented in communication with the digital world by interpreting gestures via mathematical algorithm. Numerous ways and algorithms have been proposed and implemented to achieve the goal of gesture &amp; voice recognition and its use in communicating with the digital world. Gestures can be tracked using hand movements, accelerometers and more. On the hand, Voice is recognized by Google Speech Reorganization and the reply is performed by GTTS (Google Text To Speech).  This project deals with the design and implementation of a gesture voice-controlled computer using Arduino Uno with ATMEGA32 processor and a laptop loaded with Windows 10 operating system along with low cost hardware requirements. The system can be broadly classified into two components: The Hardware part consisting of Arduino Microcontroller, the ultrasonic sensors HC-SR04 and a computer, preferably a laptop, and the software part consists of Arduino IDE and Python 3.7 IDLE with PyAutoGUI , Speech Recognition module installed. Keywords, Arduino, Gesture, Laptop, PyAutoGUI, Python, Ultrasonic
